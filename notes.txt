# handling shared libraries on mac
# export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/local/lib (for some reason this does not work, although it should according to: http://tinyurl.com/anr4m)
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/local/lib

# dynmamic lib
# You may also place the .dylib file at a nonstandard location in your filesystem, but you must add that location to one of these environment variables:
o LD_LIBRARY_PATH
o DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
o DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH

## General notes
# I had a lot of problems linking, since yywrap was referenced but not defined. I got it working by including the following at the end of newick.l (in phy/phy/testParser)
int NewickFlexLexer::yywrap() {return 1;}
