#     SEQUENCE TO OBSERVED RANDOM VARIABLE SYMBOL SPECIFICATION FILE
#
# This file defines the mapping between sequential input data and the
# observed symbols taken as input for the discrete factor graph
# (DFG). One use if for when SCFG emission models are defined in terms
# of DFGs. Then the input is typically sequences, whereas the DFG takes
# individual symbols mapped to the subset of observed random variables
# as input. This files thus defined how these observed symbols are
# defined for each index (or pair of indexes) of the input sequences.
#
# BASIC SYMBOL SPECIFICATION
#
# The specification is based on stanzas separated by blank lines. Each
# stanza defines the input symbols for an observed random variable
# (RV) of the DFG. The basic format is as follows:
#
#
# VAR_NAME:	 name_of_random_variable 
# SEQ_NAME:	 name_of_input_sequence  
# SIZE:		 size_of_symbol              (default=1)
# SYMBOL_OFFSET: offset_from_previous_symbol (default=size_of_symbol)
# INDEX_OFFSET:  offset_relative_to_current_sequence_index (default=0)
# OPTIONAL:      does_not_matter   (default=false, true when given)
#
# 
# Note that only VAR_NAME and SEQ_NAME are required, with the optional
# having default values.
#
#
# Additional description and interpretation of some of the parameters
# follows:
#
# SYMBOL_OFFSET: If SYMBOL_OFFSET is smaller than its default value of
# SIZE, then the symbols will overlap in the specied input sequence.
#
# INDEX_OFFSET: if INDEX_OFFSET differs from the default value of
# zero, the start position of the symbol is shifted accordinly
# relative to the current index. The INDEX_OFFSET value is given in
# characters, even if the symbol SIZE is greater than one.

# OPTIONAL: By default the given input sequences must be present for
# listed observed random variables or the program will terminate with
# an error. If OPTIONAL is given, the random variable will be treated
# as missing data if specified input sequence is not found. In this
# case the random variable will typically be treated as nuisance
# parameter and marginalized in the algorithmic calculations.
#
#
# EXPLICIT PAIRED DI-SYMBOL SPECIFICATION:
#
# In some applications, such as paired observations for SCFGs, the
# final symbol will be combined from a left part and a right part -
# here called a di-symbol. In these cases, the above specification
# defines both left and righ parts by default. This means, for
# instance, that the final paired-symbol will be twice as long as
# specified by SIZE. The INDEX_OFFSET will pertain to both left and
# right part, and define the shifting of the start position of
# both. However, the left part is shifted by minus the value
# INDEX_OFFSET value. 

# It is possible to specify separate SIZE and INDEX_OFFSET values for
# the left and right side of the di-symbols, by explicitly define
# separate values for the right part:
#
# R_SIZE:	        length_of_right_part        (default=SIZE)
# R_INDEX_OFFSET: index_offset_of_right_part  (default=INDEX_OFFSET)
#
