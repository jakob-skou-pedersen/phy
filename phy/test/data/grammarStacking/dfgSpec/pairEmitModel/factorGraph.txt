#            FACTOR GRAPH SPECIFICATION FILE
#
# This file spcifies factors, their neigboring random variables (RVs),
# and the factor potentials. Note that factor graphs are dual graphs
# and that the entire graph structure is therefore determined by
# specifying factors and their RV neighbors. RVs are thus only
# implicitly defined in this file.
#
# The specification is divided into stanza separated by blank
# (empty or all whitespace) lines. Lines starting with a '#' are treated as
# comments. Each stanza line consist of key / value pairs separated by
# whitespace. In general keywords of the specification are written in
# upper case followed by a colon. Each stanza has the following format:
#
# NAME:     factor_name
# NB1:	    RV_neighbor_1   (see variables.txt)
# NB2:	    RV_neighbor_2   (see variables.txt)
# POT:	    potential_name  (see factorPotentials.txt)
#
# In the current version a factor can have at most two RV
# neighbors. (It is possible to define only one neighbor, see H.prior
# in example below.) 
#
# When implementing directed graphical models, NB1 should refer to the
# parent node and NB2 to the descendent node.
#
# The example in this file specifies a simple three-state (and
# three-factor) factor graph, with the following graph structure:
#
#                     H.prior (pot=prior)
#                     |
#                     H
#                    / \
#    (pot=inner) H.01   H.O2 (pot=inner2)
#                  /     \
#                O1       O2
