#      FACTOR POTENTIAL SPECIFICATION FILE
#
# Specification of factor potentials and potentially pseudo counts for
# training.
#
#
# The specification is based on stanza separated by blank lines. Each
# stanza is defined a factor potential (pot) and should follow this
# format: 
#
# NAME:    pot_name (must be unique)
# TYPE:	   pot_type (currently one of: rowNorm, colNorm, and globNorm. See below)
# POT_MAT: pot_matrix (matrix specification in ublas format)
# PC_MAT:  pot_pseudo_counts (pseudo count matrix specification in ublas format)
# 
# A given factor potential can be used by more than one factor
# (specified in the factorGraph.txt file). Specification of
# pseudo-counts
#

# Potential types: Is only of importance in training and defines
# constraints on the potential space. Currently only three potential
# types are implemented and they are probabilistic. (It should be
# stressed that potentials need not define probability distributions,
# it is only a current restriction on training.) In 'rowNorm' each
# column must sum to one. In 'colNorm' each column must sum to
# one. And in 'globNorm' the entire matrix must sum to one. These are
# intended for implementing directed graphical models. 'rowNorm'
# should be used when modelling a relationship of the type P(NB2|NB1)
# and 'colNorm' when modelling a relationship of the type P(NB1|NB2)
# (where NB1 and NB2 are defined in factorGraph.txt).
#
# As stated in factorGraph.txt, NB1 should refer to the parent node in
# the case of directed graphical models. In general the dimension of
# the NB1 node should match the first dimension of the factor
# potential and the dimension of NB2 should match the second dimension
# of the factor potential. However, if factors only have one neighbor,
# then the dimension of the NB1 RV should match the second dimention
# of the fator potential (i.e. the potential matrix is a 1xn matrix,
# where n is the dimension of the NB1 node). This is checked by the
# dfg framework (e.g., by the constructor of the DFG class).
